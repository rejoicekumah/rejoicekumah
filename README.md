### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently learning how to use github and learning web design. 

I'm looking for help with navigating github so I can start uploading previous projects, try out some new projects, and learn more code. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: rk945@mynsu.nova.edu (Please let me know who you are and that you are from github so I don't accidentally delete your email)

Fun fact is I love cybersecurity and psychology and currently looking how to combine the two in my everyday life.
